# Algorithms Collection Playground

Welcome to the **Algorithms Collection Playground**! üöÄ

This repository serves as a space to explore and implement classic algorithms across multiple programming languages. Whether you're interested in **binary search**, **insertion sort**, or other foundational algorithms, you'll find examples and implementations here.

The main goals of this repository are:
- To store and organize well-known algorithms.
- To experiment and learn by implementing them in different programming languages.
- To foster curiosity and encourage learning through hands-on coding.

## üí° Why This Repository?
As a developer, I believe that revisiting and experimenting with algorithms is a great way to sharpen problem-solving skills. This project allows me (and others!) to:
- **Explore different languages**: See how algorithms are implemented in languages like Python, Java, C++, and more.
- **Improve understanding**: Reinforce knowledge by coding and tweaking classic algorithms.
- **Experiment freely**: Use this space as a "playground" to try new ideas, optimizations, or variations of algorithms.

## üìÇ What's Inside?
In this repository, you'll find:
- **Algorithms in multiple languages**: Each algorithm is implemented in a variety of languages.
- **Clear structure**: Files are organized by algorithm type and language.
- **Documentation**: Each algorithm comes with a brief description and time/space complexity analysis.

### Algorithms included (so far):
- **Binary Search**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- More to come as the repository evolves!

## üåç How to Contribute
Interested in contributing? Feel free to:
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork and create a new branch.
3. **Add or improve algorithm implementations** in any programming language.
   - If the language doesn't already have a folder, **create a new folder** for it and organize the files accordingly.
4. Submit a **Pull Request** with your changes.
